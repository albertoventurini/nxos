This is a small operating system for x86 PCs that I wrote years ago.

The OS was written in x86 Assembly language and had the following features:

  * 16-bit memory model ("real mode", no memory protection)
  * PC bootloader
  * preemptive multitasking
  * FAT filesystem
  * keyboard and console drivers
  * additional driver for 32-bit "real mode" memory model
  * a shell
  * some simple applications
